# Context

Alright, so here's what I've been noodling with in 2017:

### SX 1509 GPIO Expander Drivers

I have digital and PWM output working in Python on the Onion Omega 2+ and Raspberry Pi. I want to get it working in Node.JS in 2018. Also get the rest of the implementation going.

### The Golden Raider

So I play X-Wing with my partner and the 512th Sqaudron. We took home the state rivalry trophy, the Golden Raider, in December. I'm shoving speakers and LEDs up in it, controlled with a wiimote because why not?

### Self-Education

Dunno if I can afford ASU anymore. So my engineering education falls back into my own hands. Time to really get down to business on that. Probably take some Austin Community College classes.

### Bluetooth Specification

Learning more about it, because I find it interesting.
